# Indie RPG Club Webring

A webring for the indie ttrpg and larp community — including blogs, podcasters, groups, meetups, mini-cons, and small press publishers.

## Credits

This is a fork of the [Webring Starter Kit](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring). I have updated some of the dependencies and made changes to the styles of site and the web component, also added a small size banner.

Uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build a central directory for member sites. People can link to `/prev`, `/random` and `/next` and be redirected to members of the ring.

## Making your own ring

If you want to make your own ring, you can fork my code or the original one. Instructions are on the README on the [Webring Starter Kit](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring) repo.
