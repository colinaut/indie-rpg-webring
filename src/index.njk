        Once you've joined the ring, embed the web component banner code shown below or build it yourself with html using the provided links below.
    </p>

    <h3>Large Banner</h3>

    <div class="my-sm">
        <webring-banner></webring-banner>
    </div>

    <h3>Small Banner</h3>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet-small.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <div class="my-sm">
        <webring-banner-small></webring-banner-small>
    </div>

    <h3>Styling The Banner Component</h3>
    <p>The banner is a web component can be styled using css variables and by targeting parts. See <a href="https://css-tricks.com/styling-web-components/">CSS-Tricks Styling Web Components</a> for info on this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The banner wrapper can be styled just by using the element name (i.e., <em>webring-banner</em> or <em>webrind-banner-small</em>)</li>
        <li>Using css variables: <em>--wr-link; --wr-hover: #2b16ff; --wr-border: 1px solid #DDD;</em>
        </li>
        <li>Targeting the parts: <em>image, desc, prefix, title, members, info, prev, random, next</em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Build Your Own HTML</h3>
    <p>You can also just include the image, title, and links without the web component and style it yourself.</p>
    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet-html.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}
